			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2008 the UK&#8217;s Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) ruled that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2008/aug/06/dodgyscienceintvadverts">an advertisement for an organic fertilizer  claiming to be &#8220;100% chemical free&#8221; was not misleading</a> because:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When there is a colloquial understanding of a word, we can take this into account when reaching our decision. In this case, we believe that most viewers are likely to understand the term &#8216;organic&#8217; as meaning no man-made chemicals have been used to manufacture, or are present in this product. For this reason, we believe that most viewers are unlikely to be misled by the claim.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8522" src="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-01-at-18.13.28-206x300.png" alt="" width="206" height="300" /></p>
<p>To many this seemed like a largely illogical statement, including the Royal Society of Chemsitry. Their <a href="http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2008/ChemicalFree.asp"> response</a>  was to offer a £1 million bounty for anyone who could present them with a truly 100% chemical free material.</p>
<p>Five years later and needless to say  the RSC has not had to cough up. Meanwhile the term &#8216;chemical-free&#8217; is still being banded about (<a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:VvVPDucfYzUJ:fashion.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/news-features/TMG9598248/The-green-guide-to-chemical-free-beauty.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk">including articles in mainstream media</a>(chached page) , eliciting <a href="http://chemistscorner.com/why-chemical-free-claims-are-harmful/">periodic</a> <a href="http://blog.chembark.com/2012/04/06/my-chemical-free-nightmare/">complaints</a> and some highly amusing <a href="http://youngausskeptics.com/2013/02/6-household-objects-you-wont-believe-contain-actual-chemicals/">satire</a>  from bloggers (and not just the chemistry crowd,<a href="http://www.thesmartmama.com/no-such-thing-as-chemical-free-in-cleaning-beauty-products-really-really-really/"> a Mum&#8217;s blogs have joined in as well</a>). In short not much has changed.</p>
<p>I figured it might be time to see if the ASA might reconsider it&#8217;s position. And a brand of &#8216;chemical-free&#8217; deodorant that&#8217;s stocked in <a href="http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/pages/product_detail.asp?pid=3758&amp;prodid=4355">Holland and Barrett</a> (a health food shop in the UK) seemed like the perfect test bed. I completed the <a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/Consumers/How-to-complain.aspx">ASA complaints</a> form, making all the usual points about how it can&#8217;t possibly be chemical free, and this is the response I got.</p>
<blockquote><p>While we appreciate your point that all material consists of chemicals, there do not appear to be grounds to suppose that this means that consumers will be misled by the claims in this ad.  We note that the claim is qualified by a list of ingredients next to the product description.  We consider that consumers are likely to generally interpret claims such as this in the practical sense that no synthetic chemicals, as opposed to the organic constituents of the product, have been added to the product rather than in the literal sense that the product includes no chemicals whatsoever.</p>
<p>On this basis we are satisfied that consumers are unlikely to be misled to their detriment by this ad and that the advertisers are not in breach of our Code on this occasion.</p></blockquote>
<p>So pretty much the same stance they took 5 years ago, which does rather grate. But does it really matter? Maybe the consumer does understand that &#8220;chemical-free&#8221; is nonsense and  I should stop getting irritated by it.  The comments in the <a href="http://www.thesmartmama.com/no-such-thing-as-chemical-free-in-cleaning-beauty-products-really-really-really/">Smartmama.com</a> blog seem to back this up: The general feeling seems to be  an understanding that shampoo etc.  can&#8217;t be &#8216;chemical-free&#8217; , combined with annoyance at products that use the term. One particular comment sums it up nicely..</p>
<blockquote><p>Could anyone be more contemptuous of the public’s intellect than people marketing “chemical free” products?</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems like &#8220;chemical-free&#8221; marketing might be backfiring. Let&#8217;s hope so.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_8483" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 227px"><a href="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/George_Gray.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8483 " src="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/George_Gray-217x300.gif" alt="" width="217" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Prof. George Gray</p></div>
<p>Today is the 40th anniversary of an innovation in chemistry that has had, arguably, a greater impact on our society than any of the Chemistry Nobel Prize winning achievements in the past 40 year. But the man responsible, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Gray">George Gray</a>, is only known in select chemistry circles (apart from maybe a few travellers boarding <a href="http://www.hull.co.uk/news.asp?PageID=74&amp;MediaCategoryID=9&amp;NewsID=263&amp;MediaType=news">a train traveling between London and Hull that bears his name</a>). Yet you are almost certainly reading this blog on a device that owes its existence to Gray. For he and his small team, of just two post-docs, developed the first liquid crystals that were viable in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). Forty years ago today his work was published, triggering a multi-billion dollar industry and making today’s abundance of flat screen devices possible.</p>
<p>The breakthrough that emerged from Gray&#8217;s small group was the synthesis of 4-Cyano-4&#8242;-pentylbiphenyl (5CB). It had a nematic liquid crystalline phase between 22C and 35C which made it the first material that could form the bases of viable LCDs.*</p>
<div id="attachment_8486" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/5CB.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8486" src="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/5CB-300x83.png" alt="" width="300" height="83" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">4-Cyano-4&#8242;-pentylbiphenyl</p></div>
<p>Just like so many great innovations getting to this point had been far from easy, largely because there was little appetite for funding research on molecules that, at the time, had no clear applications. Turning liquid-crystals from curiosities into the ubiquitous technologies that they are today required both a burning need for new displays and the foresight of one of the more colourful government ministers.</p>
<p>Enter John Stonehouse, Minister of State for Technology under the UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Stonehouse wanted a technology capable of producing flat screen colour displays (a good 30 years before LCD TVs became the norm) with the aim of replacing cathode ray tubes that were costing the Ministry of Defence colossal sums (more than the development costs of Concorde) in royalties. So in 1968 he set up a working group consisting of military brass, civil servants and scientists to find a suitable replacement technology. The way the contracts were distributed is a far cry from how things are done today. The story goes that at one of the group’s meetings liquid-crystals were proposed as a candidate. But the key speaker was unable to answer a question about why light from the projector generated such curious patterns as it reflected off the vials of liquid-crystals. There followed an embarrassingly long silence before a voice piped up from the back of the room exclaiming “I wonder if I can help”. That voice was George Gray’s and come the end of the meeting he and his team of chemists at the University of Hull were awarded the contract to deliver room temperature liquid-crystals.  That they did and the results were patented and <a href="http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/el_19730096">published</a> by 1973 with the first LCDs in commercial devices the following year. (Cyril Hilsum was chairing the session and he was recently filmed recounting his memory of the  meeting and the development of LCDs. You can watch it here  <a href="http://youtu.be/AaB902_ds-g?t=34m3s">http://youtu.be/AaB902_ds-g?t=34m3s</a> )  <!--EndFragment--><!--EndFragment--><!--EndFragment--></p>
<p>At one time the molecules that Gray invented accounted for over 90% of all the liquid-crystals in the world’s calculators, digital watches and LCD clocks. So what became of the money that flowed in via the patents? Well the Ministry of Defence owned most of the intellectual property and made a tidy sum which offset the money they were still paying for cathode ray tubes.  Meanwhile the University of Hull, like most UK academic institutions at the time, didn’t think it was its place to own intellectual property, so the remainder of the royalties went to Gray and his team. But Hull wasn’t left completely out of pocket, the MOD continued to invest in LCD research in Hull until the patents ran out in 1992.</p>
<p>As for Stonehouse he may well have been blessed with the foresight to back LCDs, but he wasn’t so hot with his own businesses. Shortly after the first LCD devices were being manufactured his clothes were found piled on a beach in Florida with no sign of his body. He had apparently committed suicide after a series of disastrous business ventures. In reality he had<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/24/newsid_2540000/2540557.stm"> faked his own death</a> and was winging his way to Australia to start a new life with his mistress. The law caught up with him, briefly mistook him for Lord Lucan before sentencing him to several years in gaol. As if that wasn’t enough intrigue for one man he also turned out to be a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/dec/30/margaret-thatcher-spying-john-stonehouse">Czech spy</a>!</p>

I clicked on it and it took me to the <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/subjects-age-groups/teach-chemistry">UK&#8217;s Department of Education who, in conjunction with the Royal Society of Chemistry are offering chemistry graduates a £20,000 bursary to start teacher training</a>. Good news.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s wrong with this picture? Take a look at the model molecule sitting on the bench behind the teacher? Its a bit fuzzy but it looks rather unlikely to me. I&#8217;d sort of hope that someone might have come up with something better to stick on an advert for chemistry teachers. Or maybe it&#8217;s part of some cunning plan to select just the most pedantic chemistry graduates.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I just <a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_ents/status/314448328026886144/photo/1">spotted</a> the same picture in a magazine with the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/">Royal Society of Chemistry</a> logo on it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4079/4759535950_7bca6684c8.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4079/4759535950_7bca6684c8.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="225" /></a>I bet there is an interesting back story to this little episode. In January a neat communication appeared in JACS  describing &#8220;<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja309304m">Small-Molecule Inducer of Beta Cell Proliferation Identified by High-Throughput Screening</a>&#8220;. Basically the authors have induced the growth of cells that produce insulin, so opening up a possible route to cure Type 1 diabetes. Intersting enough, but not the subject of this post. I&#8217;m more concerned with the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja401118g">correction</a> published last week. It seems that 20 authors wasn&#8217;t quite enough. Eric C. Peters probably wasn&#8217;t happy about being left languishing in the acknowledgements and having to be content with a thank you for experimental support.  So come March he got promoted to the author list, leaving John Walker left all alone in the acknowledgements. You&#8217;ve got to feel sorry for him (unless the authors are referring to a whisky at the end of the day), how come he&#8217;s the only one left with a hat tip and no place on the front page? Especially given that its difficult to imagine what sort of contribution would warrant an acknowledgement on a communication&#8217;s worth of work (although granted that in this case there is and additional 12 pages of supporting info) as opposed to less than a 5% share of the author list.</p>
<p>Anyway this rather unusual correction got me thinking. What do you have to contribute to a study before you are entitled to a place on the paper&#8217;s author list? Or when does an acknowledgment suffice? My thinking is that anyone who&#8217;s made a vital contribution should be named as an author, this includes all sorts of technical support. For example I&#8217;ve worked on plenty of projects where lab technicians have prepared protein samples from bacterial cultures. In this case I&#8217;d say its pretty clear cut, the technician spent several days making samples for me to do my measurements on, so they get to be an author. However, I know of plenty of places where the same technician would have to make do with an acknowledgement (if that). Maybe the argument is that he/she hasn&#8217;t made an intellectual contribution and are merely conducting a routine role, but the same thing could be said for many of the procedures carried out by grad students.</p>
<p>Then what about the flip side? When is a spot on author list too much?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tamiflu, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir_total_synthesis">made by Roche</a> and licensed by them from Gilead and stockpiled in many countries has proved to be a big money maker for Roche. It is one of two neuramidase inhibitors currently available for the treatment of influenza, the other being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanamivir">Zanamivir</a> from Glaxo. Tamiflu is sold as its mono-phosphate salt. During the recent outbreak of avian flu due to the H5N1 virus Tamiflu was the drug treatment of choice for many physicians.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/flu.jpg"><img class="wp-image-8423 aligncenter" src="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/flu.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="203" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="text-align: left"> </span></p>
<p>Now <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b5164">questions are being asked</a> <em>again</em> about it’s effectiveness and it’s actual performance in clinical trials, the data of which has not been fully published by Roche in spite of promises to release this information. A new <a href="http://www.bmj.com/tamiflu">web site</a> has been established to achieve the aim of providing doctors and patients’ access to this information. In a hard hitting <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e7304">editorial</a> the editor of the British Medical Journal gives big Pharma a well deserved tongue (or in this case pencil) lashing, criticising the lack of information as to the clinical trial results of not just these two compounds but a number of others. Which she says must be made available to independent scrutiny.</p>
<p>It turns out that an <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b5164?ijkey=960a3f296cb064910efc119b8d3d094141671a7f&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha&amp;linkType=FULL&amp;journalCode=bmj&amp;resid=339/dec07_2/b5164">review of the data</a> on the available neuramidase inhibitors, commissioned by the British Government, discovered that around 60% of the data of the phase III trials collected by Roche has never been made available for examination.</p>
<p>Why does Big Pharma have a level of secrecy that would make the CIA look proud? Well I suppose in the first instance it’s about big money. One Tamiflu pill costs about $10, and that’s expensive. The recommended dosing regimen is 75 mg twice a day for 5 days, $100. Multiply that by the huge number of people contracting influenza and it comes to a lot of money. This year the sales are expected to <a href="http://www.ronpaulforums.com/showthread.php?401176-Flu-Shot-Profits-Tamiflu-Sales-Double-750-million-Walgreen-s-rakes-in-over-200-million">DOUBLE</a> from $350 million to around $750 million. So, I suppose that alone justifies the most of the secrecy concerning the reluctance to produce the complete trial results. Combined with a supply problem keeping the demand high also pushes the price up. I would hope that the deficit in supply is due to capacity problems and nothing else. Secondly; publishing the results of clinical trials give an insight into the companies working practices, which they most certainly don’t want made public. In the third instance if any minor complications turn up in the trials this may lead the company to tone down their significance, if there is any. Fourthly; could there be any bad publicity arising from any side effects of the compounds. No doubt there are perhaps other reasons that I am unaware of.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: left">Moving back to chemistry the optimisation of the synthesis of Tamiflu makes a very interesting read and I recommend it as an excellent source of solutions to scale-up difficulties. It can be found <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/scs/chimia/2007/00000061/00000003/art00003;jsessionid=2ufquxv89p3hd.alicehttp://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/scs/chimia/2007/00000061/00000003/art00003;jsessionid=2ufquxv89p3hd.alice">here</a> unfortunately behind a paywall. The synthesis starts off with shikimic acid and delivers Tamiflu in 17-22% yield after 15 steps. It has two azide reactions; the first one opens an epoxide to give a mixture of hydroxy azides 1 &amp; 2 in a 9:1 mixture:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/epoxide.jpg"><img class="wp-image-8424 aligncenter" src="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/epoxide.jpg" alt="" width="536" height="158" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both isomers form the same aziridine in the next step. The hydroxy azides are thermally labile, the stability being better in solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The next crucial step is the one pot sequence consisting of aziridine formation, via a Staudinger type process, using triphenylphosphine, followed by ring opening with sodium azide/sulphuric acid and finally acylation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aziridine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8425" src="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aziridine.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>This series of reactions circumvents the unfavourable thermal properties of both the aziridine and the amino azide and allows for faster reactions and higher yields while maintaining process safety and quality of the product.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">For this superb piece of process chemistry the Roche group received the Sandmeyer prize of the Swiss Chemical Society in 2006.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 60th anniversary of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf">Watson and Crick&#8217;s DNA structure paper</a> is fast approaching (25th April). So I&#8217;ve been hunting for nice DNA demos. My favourite so far is a replication of Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf">diffraction experiment</a> (which appeared in the same issue of Nature).  Franklin and Gosling&#8217;s paper featured the now famous photo 51, which contained the tell-tale information that led Watson and Crick to build their double helical model.</p>
<p>The neat thing is you can demonstrate the relationship between the patterns seen in photo 51 and diffraction off a helix using a laser pointer and a spring from a retractable ball point pen.</p>
<p>Just shine the laser through the spring, onto a wall about 3 meters away and you end up with pattern that is strikingly similar to photo 51.</p>
<p>It makes for a great lecture demo or a full lab class, were students can work out the structure of a spring from the diffraction patter. You can find full details in a really nice paper published in <em><a href="http://homepages.ius.edu/kforinas/P105/PTE000140.pdf">The Physics Teacher</a>.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a guest post by Brandon Findlay, who regularly blogs at <strong><a href="http://chemtips.wordpress.com/">ChemTips</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Best of the Annals of Improbable Research (Part 2)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s time for <strong><a href="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/?p=8411">another best-of</a></strong> from the <strong><a href="http://www.improbable.com/magazine/">Annals of Improbable Research</a></strong>. As before, I’ve gone through the freely available section of the journal looking for the most significant research I could find [1, 2].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume8/v8i3/sleep-retardant.html">“The Sleep Retardant Properties of My Ex-Girlfriend”</a></strong> catalogues <strong><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~rsb2162/">Ryan Baker’s </a></strong>search for a good night’s sleep. After overhearing friends and colleagues express a desire to “sleep with” his girlfriend, Baker developed a regression model of around eleven variables he thought might contribute to his sleeping patterns. By far the most significant was the location of sleep, with Baker sleeping a little over two hours less when at his girlfriend’s apartment (R2=0.223, p&lt;0.001).  They are no longer together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, the Annals are not immune to pseudoscience, as shown by their lamentable decision to publish <strong><a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume3/v3i6/bact.htm">this horoscope for bacteria.</a></strong> Due to the limited lifespan of bacterial cells they have simplified the stars somewhat, tracking only the position of the sun, but the predictions remain the same empty platitudes familiar to all who have browsed supermarket tabloids. ”Rich medium supplemented with casamino acids is in your future. Rev up the Embden-Myerhoff pathway!” Bah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My spirits were revived somewhat by this next article, an in depth study into <strong><a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume1/v1i6/Dead-As-A-Doornail-AIR_1-6.pdf">the “Doornail” standard of death</a></strong> (pdf). As medical science has advanced patients’ lungs and hearts have maintained function despite complete absence of brain activity, and it has become difficult to separate life from non-life. Through physical observation and electrocardiograms the authors observed no brain activity or physical movements in their test subject, a common doornail. They conclude that clinical definitions of death, which espouse a lack of brain activity, are sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the medical front also comes an idea that is well ahead of its time, <strong><a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume5/v5i2/placebos-5-2.html">the Double Strength Placebo.</a></strong> Given the strength of the flu this year we’ll need all the medicinal aid we can get, and I wholeheartedly encourage the FDA to expedite approval of the DSP. True pioneers, the authors also outline an innovative adaptation of the standard “double-blind experiment” that I think merits further study.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last article in this series was impossible to summarize effectively, though the author has <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL_-1d9OSdk">presented his work</a></strong> at a national conference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume12/v12i5/chicken-12-5.pdf">Chicken Chicken Chicken: Chicken Chicken</a></strong> (pdf) by Doug Zongker.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is a guest post by Brandon Findlay, who regularly blogs at <strong><a href="http://chemtips.wordpress.com/">ChemTips</a>.</strong> We&#8217;re glad you could join us, Brandon.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Best of the Annals of Improbable Research</strong></p>
<p>Well, almost.  For some reason my institution does not have a subscription to the Annals of Improbable Research, so this list includes only articles I have access to:  the once-per-issue free works (published before January, 2008).</p>
<p>Let’s start off with the classic <a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume6/v6i4/postal-6-4.html"><strong>Postal Experiments</strong></a>.  The author(s) decided to test the reliability, speed, and patience of USPS workers by mailing several dozen unusual packages.  Items ranged from valuable (a laminated, clearly visible $20 bill) to worthless (a wrapped brick [1]), with several absurd items thrown in for good measure (ex. a helium balloon, deer tibia and wooden postcard).</p>
<p>Then, from <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~mjmunro/Murray_Munro/Home.html"><strong>my alma mater</strong></a> comes a study on the <a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume7/v7i6/bitching.html"><strong>Second-Hand Effects of Bitching</strong></a>. It draws some interesting conclusions, but I did have trouble validating some of the references.  <em>Bitch Studies Quarterly</em>, for example, appears to be out of print.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume10/v10i4/morph-steve-10-4.pdf"><strong>The Morphology of Steve</strong></a> (pdf) must surely have boosted the Annal’s impact factor, as it lists two nobel laureates as co-authors [2].  The attempt to analyze the distribution of “Steves” in the United States began as most academic pursuits do, when the authors discovered that they had lots of otherwise worthless data.  In their own words, “[n]o scientist can resist the opportunity to analyze data, regardless of where that data came from or why it was gathered.</p>
<p>There’s a few more, but the two Annals essays on scientific writing make for a good break point.  <a href="http://members.verizon.net/~vze3fs8i/air/airpaper.html"><strong>The first</strong></a> provides a nice counterpoint to the classic Whitesides Group work, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.200400767/abstract"><strong>“Writing a Scientific Paper”</strong></a>, with an emphasis on the unspoken conventions of the publishing world.  As an example, when I first started research I was unaware of the importance of citing one’s own work (see <a href="http://chemtips.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/on-selecting-your-thesis-advisor/"><strong>here</strong></a>, <a href="http://chemtips.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/the-pitch/"><strong>here</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2012/07/15/great-research-is-dull/"><strong>here</strong></a>, for examples of my naivety), though I was quite familiar from peer review at the undergraduate level that a journal’s editor will always “pick the referee most likely to be offended by your paper, because then at least the referee will read it and get a report back within the lifetime of the editor.”</p>
<p><a href="http://members.verizon.net/~vze3fs8i/air/airphd.html"><strong>The second piece</strong></a> is by the same author, and is essential reading for those about to or planning to prepare a thesis.  A PhD thesis of course “is usually a number of disparate chapters whose most important feature is not the thoroughness of the experimental description but rather the width of the margins.” Those writing such important documents are prone to bouts of depression an existential angst, which can be greatly soothed by the assurances in this essay, key of which is &#8220;[n]o one will ever read your thesis.”</p>
<p>[1]  Arrived pulverized, after analysis by the DEA.<br />
